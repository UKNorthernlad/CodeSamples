# B2C Demos

The easiest demo to get started with is the official two-tier demo on GitHub:

* https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-dotnet-webapp-and-webapi

However, a copy has been made in this folder which has been updated to the latest Nuget packages and also has a few fixes which where preventing it from building correctly.

To use this sample, you'll need to setup the TasksWFE and TasksAPI application registrations in your Azure B2C instance, create a user flow and update the web.config will all the normal required GUID/tenant changes etc.
