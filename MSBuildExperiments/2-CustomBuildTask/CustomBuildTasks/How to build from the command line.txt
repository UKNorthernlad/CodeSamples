This is a Visual Studio .csproj which uses the VS targets to compile the CustomBuildTasks class, so you shouldn't expect to see explicitly defined Targets.

To compile this example from the command line:

1. Run msbuild.exe to perform a NuGet restore and create the required metadata files in the /obj folder:
    
      msbuild /target:restore

2. Compile the class library from the command line:

      msbuild
